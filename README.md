## 🚗 Uber-like Microservice with Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, RabbitMQ, and MongoDB

This project is a scalable, event-driven Uber-like ride-hailing microservice built with Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, RabbitMQ, and MongoDB. Designed for real-time ride requests, driver allocation, payment processing, and user management, this system leverages a microservices architecture to ensure efficiency, reliability, and scalability.

🔥 Key Features

- ✅ Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) – Independent microservices for users, rides, drivers, payments, and notifications.

- ✅ RabbitMQ for Asynchronous Communication – Event-driven system ensures smooth inter-service communication.

- ✅ MongoDB for Scalable Data Storage – NoSQL database optimized for handling real-time ride and user data.

- ✅ TypeScript for Strong Typing – Enhances maintainability, type safety, and cleaner code.

- ✅ Express.js for API Management – Lightweight and efficient framework for handling HTTP requests.

- ✅ JWT-based Authentication & Authorization – Secure access for users, drivers, and admins.

- ✅ Real-time Ride Matching & Status Updates – Efficient driver allocation using WebSockets or polling.

- ✅ Scalable & Fault-Tolerant Architecture – Ensures high availability and resilience.

# 🎯 Why This Architecture?

- ✅ Scalability – Microservices enable independent scaling of each component.

- ✅ Resilience – RabbitMQ handles asynchronous tasks to prevent request overload.

- ✅ Flexibility – Easily integrates third-party services like Stripe for payments or Firebase for notifications.

- ✅ Performance – Event-driven communication ensures fast response times.

# 📌 Future Enhancements

- 🚖 AI-based Ride Matching – Optimize driver allocation using machine learning.

- 📍 Live GPS Tracking – Implement real-time map integration using WebSockets.

- 💰 Surge Pricing Algorithm – Dynamically adjust prices based on demand.
